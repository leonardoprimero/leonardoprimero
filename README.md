## About me

I build systems where math meets code. I'm a developer with a mathematical core, passionate about turning abstract models into real-world automation. From quantitative analysis to full-stack web development, I mix tools and theories to create elegant solutions to complex problems.

## 🔬 Core stack

* **Python** — for modeling, scraping, automation, and trading bots.
* **JavaScript / TypeScript** — the language of the web.
* **React / Next.js** — for interactive, multilingual, SEO-optimized interfaces.
* **n8n** — visual automation that I often wire with code behind.
* **Firebase / Firestore** — lightweight, realtime backend.
* **Fortran** — legacy doesn’t scare me; I'm a mathematician after all.

## 📊 Quant meets Dev

I’ve worked on:

* A bot that scrapes and arbitrates multi-hop flight routes, finding routes cheaper than advertised — once got NYC for \$195.
* Automated pipelines for law and accounting firms using n8n + Google Sheets + WhatsApp.
* Clustering algorithms for market microstructure classification.
* A full-stack portfolio/blog system with category filtering, RTL/LTR support, and real-time Firestore sync.
* Web scrapers that fill Excel with rental listings across 5 platforms, built for travelers and nomads.

## 🧠 Thinking in layers

Every problem is a space. Some are countable, some are not. Some need a greedy script, others a recursive truth. I enjoy walking the diagonal — finding the one thing you didn’t list, the pattern that breaks your assumptions. That’s where the solution usually hides.

Whether it’s designing a backend, building a quant model, or debugging an async API call, I think like a set theorist and code like an engineer.

## 🤝 Let’s build

I don’t offer solutions — I build them with you. Whether you're scaling up, cleaning data, or crafting something from scratch, I’ll bring the code, logic and obsession with detail.
